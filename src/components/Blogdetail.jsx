Originally developed in 1995, it has evolved into a core web technology alongside HTML and CSS, enabling features like real-time updates, animations, and user interactivity. With its event-driven and asynchronous nature, JavaScript excels in handling user inputs, API calls, and dynamic page updates without reloading. It supports object-oriented and functional programming paradigms, and its flexibility is enhanced by modern libraries and frameworks like React, Vue.js, and Node.js for both front-end and back-end development.
